Discord Self Bot for cleaning message history in a specific channel

## What is this?

Easily delete your own Discord messages from any channel (DM or guild) using this self-bot tool. 

Works with your account's session Cookie and Authentication token header and supports optional filtering by message range.

## Features

- Delete your own message history in any Discord channel (DM or Guild)
- Customizable deletion speed
- Optional filtering with Start/End message IDs

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer
- `requests` Python package
- Your Discord **Cookie**, **Authorization Token**, and **User ID**
- The **Channel ID** (and optional **Guild ID**) to delete messages from


## How It Works

This script interfaces with Discord's public API endpoints using your account credentials.

It searches for messages authored by your user ID in a specified channel and deletes them one by one with a configurable delay.

> **Note:** The script does not use the official Discord bot API, as it is meant to operate as a self-bot.

## How To Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run `history_cleaner.py` in a terminal:

```shell
python history_cleaner.py
```

3. Follow the prompts:
    - Enter your:
        - Discord Cookie;
        - Authorization Token;
        - User ID.
    - Enter the Channel ID;
    - *(Optional)* Enter a Guild ID (for server channels, leave blank for DMs);
    - *(Optional)* Enter Start and Stop Message IDs to define deletion range.

- **Start ID**: The earliest message to begin searching from (not inclusive).
- **Stop ID**: The last message to stop searching at (not inclusive).

## Important Notes

- This script only deletes messages authored by your account.
- Start and Stop IDs are optional, but useful for fine-grained control.
- Make sure you input accurate credentials and IDs, otherwise the requests will fail.
